Data set used : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratyushpuri/remote-work-health-impact-survey-2025

The Post-Pandemic Remote Work Health Impact 2025 dataset presents a comprehensive, global snapshot of how remote, hybrid, and onsite work arrangements are influencing the mental and physical health of employees in the post-pandemic era. Collected in June 2025, this dataset aggregates responses from a diverse workforce spanning continents, industries, age groups, and job roles. It is designed to support research, data analysis, and policy-making around the evolving landscape of work and well-being.

This dataset enables in-depth exploration of:

The prevalence of mental health conditions (e.g., anxiety, burnout, PTSD, depression) across different work setups.
The relationship between work arrangements and physical health complaints (e.g., back pain, eye strain, neck pain).
Variations in work-life balance, social isolation, and burnout levels segmented by demographic and occupational factors.
Salary distributions and their correlation with health outcomes and job roles.

## Tools Used

SQL Workbench
Excel
Kaggle Datasets

## Key Findings
The case is to find out the frequency/distribution of Mental_Health_Status by work type (Work_Arrangement) is studied, with a stacked bar chart, where each column shows how many had e.g. Stress Disorder, Depression, None, ADHD, etc., for each work type (Onsite, Remote, Hybrid).

## Example Visualizations
The outcome comes with a graph where:

The horizontal axis has the types of work.
The vertical axis has the number of people per mental health condition.
Each column is colored by condition (ADHD, Stress, None, etc.).
